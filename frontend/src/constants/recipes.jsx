                "Many people will tell you to remove the skin on your chicken to cut down on fat. This is true, but if you like the taste, leave it on! You're only gaining a little fat for a lot of flavor. Plus, a little over half of the fat in chicken skin is monounsatured fat (that's a heart-healthy kind) and the notion that saturated fat is unhealthy is being <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/03March/Pages/Saturated-fats-and-heart-disease-link-unproven.aspx\">questioned</a> too. So in our opinion: dig in, skin and all!",
                "If you are cooking with wine, be aware that the amount of alcohol that evaporates could be much less than you think. In fact, <a href=\"http://old.post-gazette.com/magazine/19980903alcohol8.asp\">researchers found</a> that anywhere between 4 and 49 percent of the alcohol in a dish might remain depending on the cooking method, length of cooking, etc. If you're concerned about the amount of alcohol you're consuming, keep an eye on how much wine is going into your dish!",
                "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.",

Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money).",
                "If you find meat (especially grassfed and/or organic meat!) on sale, stock up and <a href\"http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/storagetimes.html\">freeze it</a>. Ground meat will stay good 3-4 months, while steaks, chops, etc., will be fine for at least 4 months."

Just don't buy \"cooking wine\" with added salt, food coloring, etc. ",
                "You might have heard that you should never wash mushrooms. Before you spend your precious time wiping down mushroom after mushroom with a towel, you should probably know that this is mostly a myth. While mushrooms can absorb a little water if you soak them long enough, the amount absorbed from a quick wash is not going to have much of an impact on your dish.",
                "Butter's incredible flavor has made it an extremely popular cooking fat, but it is important to know that butter has the lowest smoke point of almost any cooking fat. This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit. So while butter is great for cooking at lower temperatures, you should probably use canola oil, coconut oil, or  <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">another oil with a higher smoke point</a> for frying and other high temperature cooking.",
                "To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions, trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes.",

Brown rice is a whole grain, while white rice is brown rice stripped of some of its parts and much of its fiber and other nutrients. It is important to note, however, that all rice types raise your <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm\">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation. In fact, if it seems like it would work in the recipe, the best option would probably be so-called <a href=\"http://spoonacular.com/Another-(simpler)-Version-Of-Cauliflower-Rice-30679\">cauliflower rice</a>.",

If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.",

In fact, if it seems like it would work in the recipe, the best option would probably be so-called <a href=\"http://spoonacular.com/Another-(simpler)-Version-Of-Cauliflower-Rice-30679\">cauliflower rice</a>.",
                "Many people will tell you to remove the skin on your chicken to cut down on fat. This is true, but if you like the taste, leave it on! You're only gaining a little fat for a lot of flavor. Plus, a little over half of the fat in chicken skin is monounsatured fat (that's a heart-healthy kind) and the notion that saturated fat is unhealthy is being <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/03March/Pages/Saturated-fats-and-heart-disease-link-unproven.aspx\">questioned</a> too. So in our opinion: dig in, skin and all!",

Keep that in mind before you decide to swap. If you want to go dairy free, however, you can replace milk with unsweetened soy milk in most recipes."

Plus, a little over half of the fat in chicken skin is monounsatured fat (that's a heart-healthy kind) and the notion that saturated fat is unhealthy is being <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/03March/Pages/Saturated-fats-and-heart-disease-link-unproven.aspx\">questioned</a> too.

If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

        "instructions": "Firstly, this chicken needs to be spatchcocked.  This allows a quicker cooking time and works really well if you want to barbeque the meat.\nWith the chickens back bone facing upwards, take a sturdy pair of poultry or game scissors and cut up each side of the back bone to remove it.  Then turn the chicken over, lean on the breastbone with the heal of your hand and press hard enough to break it so that the chicken is flattened.\nMake a couple of slashes in the thickest part of each of the legs of the chicken.  This will allow the piri piri marinade to penetrate the flesh and also aid even cooking.  Place the chicken skin side up in your roasting tray (if you are roasting in the oven) or on a dish ready to go to the barbeque.\nPlace the piri piri marinade ingredients into the food processor and blend until you get a smooth pure.\nSmear the piri piri mix evenly over the chicken and place in the fridge to marinate.  Leave for a hour an hour, but longer if you can, overnight is great.\nTo cook in the oven: Pre-heat to 200C/400F/Gas 6 . Place the chicken in a roasting tray and cook for about 30 to 45 minutes.  Check after 25 to see if the juices are running clear.  If you want a more crispy finish, you can put the chicken under a hot grill for a few minutes.\nTo cook on the barbeque: Once the flames have died down on your barbeque fire, place the chicken skin side down on the centre area and cook for about 15 minutes until nice and crispy.  Then flip the bird over for about another 10 to 15 minutes until cooked through.  The cooking times will vary depending on your barbeque, so the best way is to check by piercing the thickest part of the bird around the area where the leg joins the body with a knife, press and if the juice that comes out runs clear then the chicken is ready.  If the juices are pink or red, then you need to cook for longer.\nTo make the rice, add the spices to the water you will cook the rice in and stir.  Cook as normal.  When ready, fork through the parsley, butter and some salt to taste.\nTo serve, cut the bird with your poultry scissors into 4 pieces. Cut in half lengthways, then divide the 2 halves by cutting each one between the leg and wing.  Serve with the lemon wedges and a little more fresh parsley leaves sprinkled over the top.\nTips and Variations\nThere is no need to spatchcock your chicken if it is not going on the barbeque, but it is easier, as it holds the marinade better and cooks quicker.\nThe marinade works well with chicken pieces too (thighs, legs, wings, breasts)\nThe chicken will blacken a little on the outside, this is how it is supposed to look.\nIf you dont have time to let the meat marinade for an hour, just use whatever time you have.\nServe with a simple green salad and some crisp, fresh Vinho Verde.\nI like to make extra marinade to keep in the fridge for the next time  it will keep easily for a good few weeks.",

Brown rice is a whole grain, while white rice is brown rice stripped of some of its parts and much of its fiber and other nutrients. It is important to note, however, that all rice types raise your <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm\">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation. In fact, if it seems like it would work in the recipe, the best option would probably be so-called <a href=\"http://spoonacular.com/Another-(simpler)-Version-Of-Cauliflower-Rice-30679\">cauliflower rice</a>.",

You're only gaining a little fat for a lot of flavor. Plus, a little over half of the fat in chicken skin is monounsatured fat (that's a heart-healthy kind) and the notion that saturated fat is unhealthy is being <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/03March/Pages/Saturated-fats-and-heart-disease-link-unproven.aspx\">questioned</a> too. So in our opinion: dig in, skin and all!",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.",

Although the extent of its health benefits in humans remains unclear, studies have indeed confirmed that honey can help with cold symptoms and even heal wounds and prevent infections.  If you're looking to reap the potential health benefits, dark raw honey is likely the best option."

Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny.

Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",

This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit.
